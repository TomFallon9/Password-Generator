# Password-Generator Homework #3
## Introduction

For this assignment we were asked create a browser-based web application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The Password-Generator will run in the browser with updated HTML, CSS, and JS files which will allow application to be responsive, ensuring a clean user interface. 

## Instructions

When the user clicks the generate password button they will see a series of prompts. The user must select the length of the password, between 8 and 128 characters. User will then choose the character types that they want included in the password. The choices are: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. Once selections have been made a randomly generated password matching the user's selected criteria will be displayed on the page.
